<p>Kriffo is a Polish startup dedicated to exclusive hand made products, especially leather goods.</p>

<p>The idea of the project was to create fresh and distinctive business mark and a set of materials for marketing use. For logo I used fresh and expressive typeface with nice and soft letterforms that was readable and easy to emboss on the products surface. I also created a signature for embossing and printing purposes.</p>

<p>A big part of my contribution of this project was providing complex leather journals photos for online store. I was responsible for photo shooting, preparing raw pictures and colour corrections.</p>
